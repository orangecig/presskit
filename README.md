Press kit
==========

Expert designers and developers who turn your idea into the right product.

Clients hire us to solve problems for people. So, we interview potential
customers. We sketch. We prototype. We make and ship working software.
We measure use of the software.

We like to work face-to-face with our clients. We bring their visions to
life at our offices with not much more than whiteboards, sticky notes,
sketchbooks, laptops, phones, computer code, and good old human
connections.

thoughtbot was founded in 2003 and has offices in
Austin,
Boston,
London,
New York City,
Raleigh, and
San Francisco
