# About thoughtbot

Expert designers and developers who turn your idea into the right product.

Clients hire us to solve problems for people. We interview potential customers.
We sketch. We prototype. We make and ship working software.  We measure use of
the software.

We like to work face-to-face with our clients. We bring their visions to life at
our offices with not much more than whiteboards, sticky notes, sketchbooks,
laptops, phones, computer code, and good old human connections.

thoughtbot was founded in 2003 and has offices in Boston, San Francisco, New
York City, London, Raleigh, and Austin.
